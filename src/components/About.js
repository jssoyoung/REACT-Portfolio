            I graduated from Seattle Pacific University with a B.A. in Integrated Studies (Language Arts Concentration) and got my M.Ed. in Learning and Technology at Western Governors University. For 6 years, I have taught hundreds of students, working to make a positive impact on their lives. While teaching my students to never stop learning and always work to improve themselves, I came to a realization that I wanted to be educationally challenge myself so I decided to start learning coding.

            I recently graduated from UC Berkeley Extension's Coding Bootcamp. I worked with languages such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. I also worked with technologies like Express, Node, React, MongoDB, and SQL. I was able to collaborate and work with peers on developing numerous web applications. It was through this bootcamp that I realized my desire and passion to continue pursuing coding. Now that I have graduated, I am currently seeking full stack web developing opportunities to showcase and continue my growth.

            Being a former teacher has taught me to be excellent at communication. I am super energetic, highly conscious, and flexible. I am also the most detail-oriented and highly organized person I know. Some passions of mine outside of work include traveling, bullet journaling (I live by a planner), and cooking.
